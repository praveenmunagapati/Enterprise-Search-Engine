/**
 * \brief WeakConnectivityDFS class.
 * 
 * This class can be used to solve the problem of finding weakly connected
 * components in an <b> undirected </b> graph or in a directed graph which will
 * be considered as an undirected one.
 *
 * It consists in finding components where every pair (u,v)
 * of nodes contained in it has a path from u to v and
 * from v to u.  This implementation is based on the
 * Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
 *
 * It is possible to set some restrictions after constructing a new instance
 * of this class and before running it in order to limit the results.
 *
 * After the execution, we can retrieve the results stored in an instance of the
 * ConnectedComponents class using the getConnectedComponents method.
 *
 * Check out the 'Algorithms' section in the SPARKSEE User Manual for more
 * details on this.

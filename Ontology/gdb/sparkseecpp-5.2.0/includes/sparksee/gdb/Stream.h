/**
 * \brief TextStream class.
 *
 * It allows for reading and writting Text attribute values.
 *
 * It is very important to close the stream once no more reading or writting
 * operations will be performed to ensure data is successfully stored.
 *
 * Whereas string attributes are set and got using the Value class, text
 * attributes are operated using a stream pattern.
 *
 * Use of TextStream for writing: (i) Create a TextStream instance and
 * (ii) set the stream for a text attribute of a node or edge instance
 * with the graph SetAttributeText method. Once the set attribute text
 * has been done, (iii) perform as many write operations as you need to
 * the TextStream instance. Lastly, (iv) exeucte Close to flush and
 * close the stream.
 *
 * Use of TextStream for reading: (i) Get the stream of a text attribute
 * of a node or edge instance with the GetAttributeText graph method.
 * Once you have the TextStream instance, (ii) you can execute Read operations
 * to read from the stream. (iii) The end of the stream
 * is reached when Read returns 0. Finally, (iv) execute Close to close
 * stream resources.
 *
 * Check out the 'Attributes and values' section in the SPARKSEE User Manual 
 * for more details on this.
